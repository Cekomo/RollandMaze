This is the first version of the game. To see the last version, please check for "Rolling Maze".

# RollandMaze
Try to find exit inside of the circular maze without collapsing the ball to any wall.

# How to play for Andorid
Single touch represents moving foward for the ball. You can slide through left or right
to change to direction of the maze. Bear in mind that, direction change and ball move 
mechanism works together. That means while you are swiping the screen left or right, 
the ball goes foward as well. Therefore, you should swipe and keep your finger down 
until the ball reaches the proper place of the lane in the maze. For now, only 
direction change is not available. 

# How to play for Desktop
The mouse swipes replace the touches of screen. Other than that, the logic is the same. 

Thanks for playing RollandMaze :).
